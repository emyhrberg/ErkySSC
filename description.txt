﻿[c/FFFF00:Erky's SSC (Server Sided Characters)]

[c/00FF88:How to use]
Start by joining or creating a server with this mod enabled. When you connect, the server creates a new server-side character for you. Your character’s name and appearance are copied, and your character only contains the starting items and stats defined by the server. 
From that point on, your progress is saved and loaded exclusively by the server.

[c/00BFFF:Features]
- Fully server-sided characters (SSC)
- Control which client-side mods are allowed
- Ban items on the server
- Chat messages when boss summons are used
All features are configurable.

[c/00BBFF:How it works]
Character data is saved in regular intervals and on save & exit like usual
On rejoin, the character is loaded from the server
Characters are bound per world and per player’s SteamID
All character data is stored on the server.
Server-side character files are stored at: tModLoader/ErkySSC/<WorldName>/<SteamID>/
