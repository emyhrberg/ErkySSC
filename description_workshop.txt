Erky's SSC (Server Sided Characters)

This mod will create a new character when you first join a server with this mod enabled.
The player files are saved when you save & exit and in periodic intervals.
The player files are then re-loaded from the server when you re-join.

This mod works by uploading local player's files to the server's machine and binding it to the world name and the local player's steam ID
Server files are stored on server's machine, under ..tModLoader/ErkySSC/<WorldName>/<YourSteamID>/

You can customize start items, mana and health in the config.

Features:
- SSC
- Allow/disallow client sided mods from the server
- Display chat message when a boss summon is used
- Ban items from the server

Everything is configurable in the config.
